# Our Tech Stack
I've found that it's pretty interesting to see what other people use on their website and how they use it to scale their application. So I decide, why not implement it on my Startup? So here it is, us being transparent about our technologies that we use.

# HTML and CSS

- We use two templates, [Stack](https://themeforest.net/item/stack-multipurpose-html-with-page-builder/19337626) (Themeforest) for Imam.tech and [Velonic](https://shapebootstrap.net/item/1525168-velonic-admin-dashboard-frontend) (Shape Bootstrap) for campus.Imam.tech. It's simply to ease the development process and to be focused on the features rather than focusing on the template.
- [BEM](http://getbem.com/) is heavily used whenever we need custom component from the default ones provided by either Stack or Velonic.
- There is zero to none interest on HTML preprocessor currently. For CSS, we use SASS just to make it easier to maintain BEM methodology.

# Javascript

- We use Webpack.

# PHP

- Yep, we use PHP, but trying really hard to maintain the best practice so it won't be a messy project.
- Heavily used on [Jupeter Clean Code adaption for PHP](https://github.com/jupeter/clean-code-php) (From Robert C. Martin). We want to add some other rules to make our code easier to read and lovely to develop on, might add one specific repo for it.

# Laravel

# Git

- We use Github for all of our cloud repository. Why? Because lots of deployment sites (like Heroku) already makes easy integration with Github, and because if I ever want to get a side job in the future, my Github will look more awesome because most of recruiter see your Github, and it's just a nice impression to look that you're spending lots of your time contributing on Github even on your private repository.
- I choose bash over any git client.
